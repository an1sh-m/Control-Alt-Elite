/**
 * A simple smoke test for the authentication flow using {@link AuthService}.
 * <p>
 * This standalone test verifies basic user registration and login functionality
 * against the connected SQLite database. It ensures that:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A test user can be created and logged in successfully.</li>
 *   <li>Incorrect password attempts are correctly rejected.</li>
 *   <li>The database being used is printed for verification purposes.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This is not a formal JUnit test â€” it is designed to be run manually
 * to confirm that authentication and database connectivity work end-to-end.
